FIRST WEEK OPEN-SOURCE STUFF
============================

HEAVY DOCUMENTATION PLEASE!!!!!!!!
MATTERS MORE THAN JUST THE CODE YOUR WRITE!!!!
AND ALSO MAKE SOME EFFORT TO MARKET AND ADVERTISE IT!!!

1. Dropping pictures into drop down menus and accordions and animating them
   accordingly, as in vidmuster.com. 
   This will work when they include your package, jquery, and the jquery
   drop-down package too.
   So the includes should eventually be like this (sort of):
   <script type="text/javascript" src="[...]jquery.js"></script>
   <script type="text/javascript" src="[...]jquery.bla.js"></script>
   <script type="text/javascript" src="[...]drop-accordion"></script>
   ============== END OF INCLUDES ================================
   And the drops should work like this:

     +-----+---------+---------+--------+
     |     |         |         |        |
     |     |         |         |        |
     |     |         |         |        |
     |     |         |         |        |
     |     |         |         |        |
     |     |         |         |        |
     +-----+---------+---------+--------+
   If only one image was copied to the accordion menu tab above, then 
   the image should fill the first column which is the first <td>
   element in the <tr> shown above.

   So the user must leave a <td> in a <tr> so that if fills that <td> or else
   it just fills the whole tr.
   If the user does not use <tr> at all, it just fills the whole element 
   there.
   Gotta implement this. No one else has done this. I can do this and all
   things with God who has been helping and will continue to help me.
   In God I and my family trust.
   What can people do with this:
   1) Create a table of images only (without the accordion facility)
   for your users. And drop images into it.
   2) Do 1) but should have accordion support.
   3) Create a table of images in an accordion with other things in the 
   table.
   2) Make playlists easily.
   3) Use ordinary accordions without drag-and-drop and image features.
   4) Store data associated with the image within the div element that	
   you make draggable-and-droppable so that the info. can be displayed
   at every row of the table.
   5) Tweak as appropriate. Make it serve vidmuster's purpose as much as
   possible. Use CSS3 with CSS2 fallback. Use HTML5 with fallback too.
   Maybe provide the other forms of html code and also the other forms of
   css3 code. But just put HTML5 as an aside.
   done!! You still need to write a lot of documentation for this though.

2. Next, vidmuster. Maybe until you leave.
   jQuery + PHP. Do only what's necessary and be modular. Start early too.

4. PHP redirect library. Specify a bunch of real urls and their mappings to
   the virtual urls on a page as in Django python framework.
 
5. You could implement any of these in php and ship the code:
   https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/#other-batteries-included
Don't add until you finish this before the 17th!
DOCUMENTATION AND WRITINGS
==========================
1. Useful queries for querying web databases.
   Resources: educlinks.com/get_rec.php
   very useful.

2. Documentation and writings on how to do recaptcha using the google
   recaptchalib using educlinks as a case study.
   very useful.
