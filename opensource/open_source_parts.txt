PARTS OF EDUCLINKS THAT I CAN OPEN-SOURCE
=========================================
1. The drop down menu. Remember to write tons and tons of documentation.
   Start tomorrow.
   Make a jquery plugin (that plugins very easily). The plugin should be
   able to create a simple drop down menu in some formats:
   i) The top-bar navigation format (or horizontal)--
      Like the navigation that appears on top of a lot of sites.
      Make it html5 if supported by the page (or the user could put a 
      flag to indicate html5 support), else just use html4 or xhtml1.
   ii) The side bar navigations (or vertical).
   iii) Standalone drop down menus.
   iv) Transparent ones.
