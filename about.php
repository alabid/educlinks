<h3>About Edulinks.com</h3>
<p>This page is still under construction. But here is a brief description of edulinks.com and its intent.</p>
<p>Edulinks.com is meant to serve the entire educational community and to provide strong and lasting bonds within this community in order to further ease the flow of information around the globe. This website was built in less than a week (so don't expect that it will be perfect) by Daniel Alabi using safe, secure, and free open-source development tools like JQuery, PHP, and MySQL to allow for a more open development environment and to prevent the use of proprietary tools and stall its accompanying disadvantages.</p>
<h3>The Man behind the screen:</h3>
<p>Edulinks.com is owned and maitained by Daniel Alabi, a student at Carleton college, MN, US. Presently a freshman at the college, he is an international student from Nigeria who got a scholarship to study in the US via the USAP program. Daniel believes that everyone should have access to information. This is better enhanced by an interactive cooperation between the different levels in the educational hierarchy not by static gathering of information. Daniel. For more info about the creator of Edulinks.com and his future plans, visit <a target="_blank" href="http://alabidan.wordpress.com">this page</a></p>.
<p>Daniel hopes to involve more people in maintaining and further expanding the facilities at edulinks.com in order to provide a lasting gateway of information for all.</p>
